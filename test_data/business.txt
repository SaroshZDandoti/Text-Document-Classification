The Nifty 50, one of Indiaâ€™s two premier stock market indices, ended Friday at a record 15,436 points.
This happened at a time the Indian economy is struggling through the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic, with the slowdown expected to last through much of this year.
The economy is likely to be in slow-burn rather than experiencing the quick contraction seen last year.
Calculations based on data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy show that the corporate profit of publicly listed companies -- measured by their profit after tax as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) -- has been falling over the years. GDP is the measure of the economic size of the country. The ratio peaked at 5.84% in 2007-08.
It was down to 3.46% of the GDP in 2013-14, before plunging to a two-decade low of 1.07% in 2019-20.
